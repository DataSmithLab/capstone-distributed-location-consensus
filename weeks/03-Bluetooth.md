# Creating Graphs from Code; What is Malware?

## Topics

This week's assignments will help you gain an understanding about bluetooth low energy.
* What is Bluetooth low energy? What are the applications of Bluetooth Low Energy? 
* How do developers map Bluetooth Low Energy signal strength to distances? Is this approach accurate?

Reading [Corona: Positioning Adjacent Device with Asymmetric Bluetooth Low Energy RSSI Distributions](http://haojianj.in/resource/pdf/corona_uist_paper.pdf) [Video](https://vimeo.com/149240808)



## Reading

Please read the following:
* [Corona: Positioning Adjacent Device with Asymmetric Bluetooth Low Energy RSSI Distributions](http://haojianj.in/resource/pdf/corona_uist_paper.pdf) 
* [Corona Video](https://vimeo.com/149240808) 
* [Corona Presentation slides](http://haojianj.in/resource/pdf/corona_uist_presentation.pdf)
* [Tracko: Ad-hoc Mobile 3D Tracking Using Bluetooth Low Energy and Inaudible Signals for Cross-Device Interaction](https://www.christianholz.net/2015-uist15-jin_holz_hornbaek-tracko-ad-hoc_mobile_3d_tracking_using_bluetooth_low_energy_and_inaudible_signals_for_cross-device_interaction.pdf) This paper involves many low-level details. You may ignore the low-level algorithm details but focus on the big picture.

* **Smartphone Team**: Consider to watch [Android Development for Beginners - Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fis26HvvDII). 
  

## Tasks

Now both teams should have the two repositories running. This week's programming task is to read the source code and locate the key code snippets.
**Please look for source codes that are relevant to the following questions. Each of you can work on one of the questions.**


[Calibration app](https://github.com/DP-3T/dp3t-sdk-android) 
1. How does the phone generates a random message? 
2. How do the phones exchange messages?
3. How does the phone store messages locally? What message does the phone send to the server? 
4. How does the phone check if the user is exposed for a long enough time?


[dp3t-sdk-backend](https://github.com/DP-3T/dp3t-sdk-backend)
1. How does the server encrypt/decrypt users' data?
2. What data does the server return to the phones?
3. How does the server handle data from users who got CoVID-19?
4. What data would be stored on the server?


## Weekly Questions
Answer the following questions on Canvas:

* What is the difference between Bluetooth low energy and standard Bluetooth? => You will need search google to find the answer. 
* How do developers map Bluetooth Low Energy signal strength to distances? Is this approach accurate?
