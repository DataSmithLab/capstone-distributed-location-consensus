# Graph Embedding II: metapath2vec

## Topics

Now we know about *word2vec* and *node2vec*. We also understand why we can't directly apply *node2vec* on HinDroid. This week we are going to study metapath2vec which will address this shortcoming.

## Reading

### metapath2vec
Pls go through the [paper](https://ericdongyx.github.io/papers/KDD17-dong-chawla-swami-metapath2vec.pdf) thoroughly. We are going to majorly focus on this paper next Wednesday.

The gist of the paper is that we choose the *type* of metapath to traverse to generate a neighbourhood. By doing so we don't let a specific edge type dominate the rest while generating the neighbourhood.
